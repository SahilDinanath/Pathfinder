# Pathfinder: Pathfinding Visualization Website

![Pathfinder Logo](pathfinder_logo.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to Pathfinder, a web-based tool for visualizing pathfinding algorithms in action. Whether you're a student learning about algorithms or a developer looking to optimize routes in your applications, Pathfinder is here to help you understand and explore various pathfinding algorithms.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Watch as Pathfinder visualizes the process of finding the shortest path in real-time.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Choose from a variety of pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra's, A*, and more.
- **Custom Grids:** Create custom grids to simulate different environments and challenges.
- **Step-by-Step Control:** Control the speed of the visualization and step through the algorithm's execution.

## Demo

Check out our live demo at [pathfinder-demo.com](https://pathfinder-demo.com) to experience the visualization firsthand.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### Installation

No installation is required. Simply visit our website at [pathfinder-demo.com](https://pathfinder-demo.com) and start visualizing pathfinding algorithms.

## Usage

1. **Choose Algorithm:** Select a pathfinding algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. **Create Grid:** Click and drag on the grid to create walls.
3. **Set Start and End Points:** Click on cells to set the start and end points for the algorithm.
4. **Visualize:** Click the "Visualize" button to see the algorithm in action.
5. **Customize:** Adjust the visualization speed and step through the algorithm if needed.

## Supported Algorithms

- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Algorithm
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
